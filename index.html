        <p>As television screens across the country flashed with the news of the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police, millions banded together in an outcry against police brutality.</p>

        <p>Police brutality and misconduct has gained <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/george-floyd-black-lives-matter-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">national headlines</a> in recent years. Many Amercians have spoken out against these abuses through protests and demonstrations.</p>

        <p>Most famously, the <a href="https://blacklivesmatter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Lives Matter</a> movement has formed out of this public outcry, beginning with the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/02/25/trayvon-martins-death-set-off-movement-that-shaped-decades-defining-moments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">death of Trayvon Martin</a> in 2012. With this rise in police brutality, policing systems across the United States have faced backlash for their historic misconduct against African-American people. </p>

        <p> <a href="http://www.crimevictimsupdates.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Andrew Karmen</a>, professor of sociology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, conducted research on the sociological aspects of policing and is the author of “Issues In Policing:Investigating Current Controversies.” He believes that the Black Lives Matter movement has sparked conversations about police conduct. </p>

        <p>“The rise of the Black Lives Matter in 2014 and the murder of George Floyd in 2020 brought a great deal of attention to all aspects of police conduct which was very appropriate,” Karmen said. </p>

        <p> New York has been a particular hub for Black Lives Matter protests following the <a href="https://www.changethenypd.org/ericgarner" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">death of Eric Garner</a> in 2014. Garner was killed in the New York borough of Staten Island after being placed in a prohibited chokehold by New York Police Department (NYPD) officer Daniel Pantaleo. His death sparked concerns regarding NYPD conduct and relations with New York civilians. </p>

        <p> The NYPD has faced <a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/subway-rider-shot-accuses-nypd-recklessly-opening-fire-brooklyn-station/5855506/?os=avdavdxhup&ref=app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">legal claims</a> of being careless and reckless and has been accused of showing leniency to officers who illegaly <a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/nypd-stop-and-frisk-report/5821666/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stop and frisk</a>.</p>

        <p> With these recent claims, data can be analyzed to see how citizens are being affected by this conduct. Analyzing the complaints filed with the <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/ccrb/index.page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NYC Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB)</a>, an independent agency that moderates and investigates civilian complaints against NYPD officers for abuse of authority, excessive force, etc., the misconduct of the officers and incidents between police and civilians can be quantified and better understood by the public. </p>

        <p> Upon its creation, the CCRB faced major backlash from the NYPD. Their recommendations are often ignored and disregarded by the NYPD, Karmen said. </p>

        <p> “The creation of the CCRB in 1966 was resisted by NYPD officers in the Police Benevolent Association (PBA),” Karmen said. “Ever since then, the police department has sought to undermine the ability of the CCRB to do its job effectively.” </p>

        <p> The <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Civilian-Complaint-Review-Board-Complaints-Against/2mby-ccnw/data_preview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">data</a> given on their website accounts for all complaints filed against the NYPD from 2000 to 2024. The data analyzed in this article will account from the first filed complaint in 2000 to the last filed complaint on October 5, 2024, the date in which the data was analyzed. The data was analyzed by creating pivot tables to dissect findings. </p>

        <p> The data showed that over 33% of all complaints filed with the CCRB occurred in Brooklyn, NYC's most populated borough, according to <a href="https://metropolismoving.com/blog/new-york-city-population-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metropolis Moving</a>.</p>

        <p> The data also showed that the highest number of complaints were filed with the CCRB in 2006, with nearly 8,000 complaints filed. This is less than 1% higher than 2009, which had the second highest recorded number of complaints. This shows that complaints filed with the CCRB do not correspond to recent NYPD misconduct. </p>

        <p><div style="min-height:434px" id="datawrapper-vis-tmd77"><script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/tmd77/embed.js" charset="utf-8" data-target="#datawrapper-vis-tmd77"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/tmd77/full.png" alt="Around 4,000 complaints in 2000 when the CCRB was created, steadily rising until peaking in 2006 with over 7,000 complaints, steadily decreasing until 2024 with a two smaller peaks in 2019 and 2023." /></noscript></div></p>

        <p> There is about a 5% increase in the number of complaints filed in 2023, the most year-end total of complaints filed since 2000. This does not show a significant increase in the number of complaints between 2000 and 2023. And, about 6% of all complaints filed were substantiated. </p>

        <p> Over 14% of complaints were unsubstantiated. This shows that more complaints end up unanswered than answered. Bahar Ostadan and Liam Quigley of the <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/has-policing-changed-since-eric-garner-was-killed-heres-what-a-decade-of-data-shows" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gothamist</a>, a local New York-centric blog, described this relationship between the NYPD and CCRB findings. </p>
        
        <p> “Though CCRB reports say the agency is substantiating more complaints of officer misconduct thanks to video evidence, data shows it hasn’t resulted in more criminal prosecution or internal discipline of officers,” Ostadan and Quigley said. </p>

        <p> The most represented reason for police contact is classified as "other" at 22.25%. The second highest is "PD suspected C/V of violation/crime - street," meaning police suspicion of a crime or violation on the street at 18.97%. This demonstrates that the majority of complaints filed stem from police interactions with civilians on the street. </p>

        <p> This dataset presented a number of limitations during the analyzation process. The data only accounts for incidents that have formal complaints. There is a possibility that there have been a considerable amount of more incidents by the NYPD than accounted for. The CCRB data may not give a full picture into the true amount of incidents and misconduct of the NYPD. </p>

        <p> The data is also limited as some of the data entries are missing the full date and only include the year and month or only the year. This can cause inconsistencies within the data in accounting for the date and time frame for each complaint. </p>


        <p> As the Black Lives Matter movement continues to grow, the recommendations of the CCRB can be utilized to help prevent future accusations of misconduct. As of now, it is unclear whether the NYPD and CCRB can come to a consensus on police activity. </p>

        <p> “The NYPD commissioner followed CCRB recommendations in just 55% of cases last year,” Ostadan and Quigley said. </p>
